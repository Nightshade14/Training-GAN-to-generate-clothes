## Overview

Welcome to the GAN Clothes Generator project! This project aims to generate high-quality images of clothes using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). By training a GAN on a dataset of clothing images, we can create realistic and diverse new clothing designs.

## Introduction

This project leverages the power of GANs to generate novel images of clothes. The main components include a generator that creates new images and a discriminator that evaluates their realism. By iterating through training, the generator improves its ability to produce realistic clothing images.

## Features

- **High-Quality Image Generation:** Generates realistic and diverse clothing images.
- **Customizable Training:** Easily modify training parameters and architecture.
- **Pre-trained Models:** Includes pre-trained models for quick setup.

## Dataset

- The model is trained to generate images similar to FashionMNIST data. It generates grayscale images of 28 x 28  size.


## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gan-clothes-generator.git
cd gan-clothes-generator
pip install -r requirements.txt
